# Code EXpress (CEX)
The might be plenty of other books, training and blogs about Python. But we aren't afraid.
Over the multiple years we are writing for you about the multivendor networks, their operations and automation. And we are getting your feedbacks, which we value a lot. These feedbacks pointed us in the direction of the CEX. We are going to provide you the same quality material on the Python for networkers. We don't pretend to cover all the use cases, approaches or modules. But we will cover what works from our experience, and what we use ourselves.
